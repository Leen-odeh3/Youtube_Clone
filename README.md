# Youtube-Clone
This project was built with the aim to challenge myself, to keep practicing and learning by doing. It contains the same basic functions as the original site, such as searching for videos, playing them or adding them to the WatchLater list. It is also possible to like videos, adding them to the LikedVideos list, as well as to subscribe to channels.
